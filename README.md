## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [DFX SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd VaultNoteAi
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
cd src/VaultNoteAi_frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Internet Computer replica and deploy canisters
```bash
cd ../..
dfx start --background
dfx deploy
```

### 4. Start the frontend development server
```bash
cd src/VaultNoteAi_frontend
npm run dev
```

- The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
- The backend canister runs at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Development Scripts

- `npm run dev` – Start the frontend dev server
- `npm run build` – Build the frontend for production
- `npm run lint` – Lint the frontend code
- `npm run generate` – Generate new candid interface after backend changes

---

## 🔒 Security & Environment

- All notes are encrypted client-side (see `src/VaultNoteAi_frontend/utils/encryption.ts`).
- Authentication is managed via `src/VaultNoteAi_frontend/hooks/useAuth.ts` and `AuthProvider.tsx`.
- For production, ensure you set the correct environment variables and network settings (see below).

### Frontend Environment Variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- Set `DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- Use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
